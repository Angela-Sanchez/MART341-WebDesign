# Web Browsers
- Web browsers are software programs that read instructions that web designers create using *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript* and convert them to viewable layouts.
- The browser communicates with servers over the network to retrieve documents and images and interpreters such as JavaScript and other rendering engines to produce the layout we see when we request a webpage.
# Document Object Model (DOM)
- The DOM provides interface to a document and decides how the document is to be accessed and changed. It represents documents as nodes on a tree structure so that programming software can modify the content.
- The DOM is an essential step in creating a webpage and helps with styling objects and to correct incorrect HTML.
# HTML, XML, XHTML
- *HTML* is the foundational language of the structure of a page's content. It displays document nodes and can be further embedded with additional content.
- *XML* functions to complement HTML and describes document nodes. It allows specific elements to update without refreshing the page.
- *XHTML* serves as a bridge between the other two languages and serves to help correct incorrect HTML on mobile devices, which do not have the same capabilities as computer browsers.
# Four Essential Elements of HTML Pages
1. Mandatory structure
2. Properly nested tags
3. Closed elements
4. Lowercase elements and attributes
# index.html Page
- This is the master HTML file of a website. It should be located inside the folder repository of the page you are working with.
# Review
- I am not sure I understand the question for this, I could not find it in our notes. When I searched I found that clean code consists that which is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to modify.
