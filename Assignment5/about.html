<h1>Why I Chose These Ideas</h1>
<h2>Educational</h2>
<p>I chose to talk about educational websites because we encounter these every day since we are college students. <br /> I also use these websites to learn about topics that interest myself and my family.</p>
<h2>Business</h2>
<p>I chose business websites because I frequently use them to make purchases online and to learn more about a company.</p>
<h2>Personal Blog</h2>
<p>I often use personal blogs for cooking recipes and crafting ideas for my child and family. <br />I will likely use the form of a personal blog for my own website.</p>
