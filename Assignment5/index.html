<h1>Types of Websites</h1>
<h2>Educational</h2>
<p>Educational websites provide information for educational institutions or online courses.<br /> They can also provide resources for educational materials.<Br /> Our UM website is an example.</p>
<h2>Personal Blog</h2>
<p>Personal blogs are a way for people to write about one particular topic that interests them. <br />They usually provide information as well as photos, sometimes they provide instructions. <br /> Examples of blogs include travel, food, crafting, etc.</p>
<h2>Business</h2>
<p>Business websites provide information for small businesses or corporations.<br /> They often provide links for viewing products, self-checkout, and payment. <br />They almost always provide information for the company as well.</p>
<h2>Tone of Website</h2>
<p>The tone of a website is important, as it conveys the message you would like to send based on your topic. For my website, I may use a playful tone.</p><br />
