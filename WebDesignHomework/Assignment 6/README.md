<h1>Plans for my website</h1>
<ul>
    <li>For my website I think I'd like to develop a creative blog in which I present crafting ideas and other fun elements for parents of preschool-aged children.</li>
    <li>This aligns with my lifestyle right now, being a mom of a 4-year-old.</li>
    <li>I want the tone to be playful and create feelings of happiness and inspiration.</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>This week's assignment was a bit more challenging than others we have done. I enjoyed adding HTML elements. I found adding additional elements, such as strikethrough and acronyms to be tedious because they weren't needed. I am finding that HTML takes a lot of work to make a simple webpage (and mine still looks like they did in the late '90's!)</p>
<p>I had a difficult time with the style elements, as this was not touched on much during our week's lessons. I could not figue out how to accomplish the width attributes. So far I do not feel I have much balance in my layout. I would definitely like to learn more about CSS, as of right now I feel very lost with this.
<p>What I enjoy most about this is that we can create something that suits our interests. I am going to have fun adding elements of creativity and playfulness in my project.
