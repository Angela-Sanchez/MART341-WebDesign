Designate which page you're working on this week (e.g., **faq.html**) --I actually made changes to all three of my pages this week, index.html, about.html, and resources.html. I used the CSS stylesheet to create uniformity, especially for navigation and background.

Required Techniques (Must Have):

Create a page with an external CSS style sheet
Use at least 1 class selector --I used several class selectors: "cake", "decorating-tools", and "about-me" to add background color to specific sections, padding, and center alignment.
Use at least 1 ID selector --I used ID's "title" and "about-me-text" to center text, remove extra padding on one of my sections, and designate a special font for my "About Me" page.
Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:

Different background colors --I added new background colors to both my top navigation and within the tables displaying my recipes and main information. 
Different font colors --Separate font colors are used for links and headings
Positioning
Opacity
Text Alignment --I used a lot of center and left alignment throughout all of my pages and condensed these when I made my CSS stylesheet
Borders --I used padding throughout my page on my tables and went with a borderless style. I also used the border-radius feature on my images and videos to add smoothness to my page.
