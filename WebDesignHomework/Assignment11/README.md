This week I am working on my index.html page, although I am updating all three of my pages that link together.

Required Techniques (Must Have):

Create a page with an external CSS style sheet - I copied over all of my pages, style sheet, and images folder.

Add hover effects to enhance interactivity - I added hover text decoration:underline to all of my buttons for my navigation across my pages. I also added hover to underline my links throughout.

Use an external font that is self-hosted - I downloaded a font and really tried to get it to work for my navigation in my fonts.css folder, but could not figure out how to get it to work. I'm not sure what I did wrong. So I ended up linking it the same as the other from Google fonts.

Use an external font from a font library - I added external fonts from Google Fonts to replace my navigation buttons at the top and h1 on all pages.

Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:

Experiment with different font styles

Adjust font-weight for emphasis - I adjusted my font-weight to bold for all links to make them easy-to-find.

Use text-decoration to add or remove underlines, lines through text, etc. - I added text-decoration:none to all of my links to remove the underline, then added the hover underline decoration for all links (already mentioned)

Adjust spacing (letter-spacing, line-height, or word spacing) for readability

Align text or elements for a clean layout

Try pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes for additional styling effects - I used the pseudo selector a:hover for all of my links and button:hover for my button (both were used to add underline during hover). I also used p::first-letter to adjust the size of the first letter of the paragraph to appear slightly larger, this was mainly for my About Me page.
