This week I worked on: resources.html

Select at least 6 of the following techniques to implement:

Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page. -- I included a lot of width elements throughout my page in many different sections on my style sheet. I changed my decorating-tools section from a table to a box.

Overflow – Manage how content is displayed when it exceeds the element’s boundaries. -- I used the overflow:visible command for my decorating-tools box.

Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation. -- I used solid borders on my buttons. I also adjusted the radius of my buttons, videos, and photos.

Margin – Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements. -- I used the margin feature to adjust the space around my decorating-tools box.

Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border. -- I used padding in several places including my buttons, different text boxes, and around the decorating-tools box holding the bulk of my text. 

Display: Inline / Inline-block – Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others. -- I used the inline-block feature for my navigation buttons.

Dropdown – Create a dropdown menu for navigation or content organization.

Position – Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.
