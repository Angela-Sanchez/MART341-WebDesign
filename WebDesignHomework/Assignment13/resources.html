       <p><h1>Decorating Tips and Tools</h1></p>
    <hr width="75%">
        <p>Whether you are just beginning your decorating journey, or have been decorating for a while, there are supplies that every baker should have on hand. Though these supplies are optional, they make for a pleasant decorating experience and allow the versatiity to create to your heart's desire.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;";><i>For most of my tools I tend to stick with the <a href="https://wilton.com/" style="padding:0%; text-decoration:solid;" target="_blank"><b>Wilton</a></b> brand. They are quality items that will hold up and are fairly inexpensive when starting out, so they are referenced in most cases.</i></p>

                <p><h2>TURNTABLE OR CARDBOARD BASE</h2></p>
                    <li>It's important to have a solid base for your cake, as you'll likely need to turn it as you decorate. If you plan to decorate more cakes in the future you can purchase a <a href="https://a.co/d/aA9h6HO" style="padding:0%" target="_blank"><b><i>turntable.</i></b></a> They are great for quick decorating and do not require much labor.
                    </li>
                <br/>
                    <li>If decorating is not something you plan to do much of and you'd like to keep it simple, a <a href="https://a.co/d/9VK2ThX" style="padding:0%" target="_blank"><b><i>cardboard cake base</i></a></b> alone works just fine. They are disposable, portable, and easy to turn on a flat surface, but do require a bit more manual labor. 
                    </li>

                    <li><a href="https://a.co/d/5jWM2Sl" style="padding:0%" target="_blank"><b><i>Spatulas</i></b></a> are very helpful for stacking and applying icing your cake.

                <p><h2>DECORATING SETS</h2></p>
                    <li>There are many different <a href="https://wilton.com/shop/tools/shop-all/decorating-sets/" target="_blank" style="padding:0%"><b><i>decorating kits</i></b></a> on the market. They usually include different piping tips and piping bags. These are essential to create texture and design on your cake or cupcake. The large piping tips also serve to add fluffy layers between your cake sections.</li>

                <p><h2>COLORING AND DECORATIONS</h2></p>
                    <li><i>Food-grade coloring</i> is a fantastic choice for creating beautiful custom cakes and cupcakes.</li> 
                    <br /><li>There are many natural options, such as <a href="https://www.watkins1868.com/products/baking-food-coloring" style="padding: 0%;"><b><i>Watkins</i></b></a>, which are plant-based and do not contain artifical dyes. I've found they typically bake to a pastel shade so you need much more than artificial coloring. They are great for coloring frosting.</li> 
                    <br /><li>Artificial coloring (FD&C synthetic dyes), especially gels, can be used to create bright and vivid cakes.</li>

                <br />
                    <br /><li>Some decorations can be piped, but for others, a quick and simple purchased <i> icing decoration/transfer </i> is an attractive option. You can find these online or at most stores. For the cake below I used a seasonal ghost icing decoration for my daughter's October birthday. <i>Sprinkles</i> of all kinds can add a burst of color and fun to any cake or cupcake.</li>
