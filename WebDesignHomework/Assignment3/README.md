# This week I learned about:
## The Internet

This week I enjoyed watching all of the videos about the internet and learned quite a few new things I had never known before. 
- Differences between the internet and the web
- How the internet travels (through fiber optic cables, radio, electricity), and that the wires are actually in the ocean
- Differences between web development and web design
- Website structure and how information is stored in databases and flows via the internet
## Markdown

I really enjoy using Markdown. The tutorial provided in the module was actually fun for me to do. This reminds me of my first glimpse into web design when I was in middle school in the '90s and began to design my own websites based on these same codes. The README tutorial also helped explain why these files are important.
## Visual Studio Code

This portion of the module was a bit confusing for me and took me a while to understand. Some of the links on the module are broken as well. It was helpful to alternate back and forth to the assignment on Canvas and the module.
