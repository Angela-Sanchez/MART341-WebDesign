# This week I learned about:
## The Internet

This week I enjoyed watching all of the videos about the internet and learned quite a few new things I had never known before. 
- Differences between the *internet* and the *web*
- How information travels (through fiber optic cables, radio, electricity), and the tangible linking cables that are actually in the ocean
- Differences between *web development* and *web design*
- Website structure and how information is stored in databases and flows via the internet
## Markdown

I really enjoy using **Markdown**. The tutorial provided in the module was actually fun for me to do. The README tutorial also helped explain why these files are important.This reminds me of my first glimpse into HTML when I was in middle school in the '90s and began to design my own websites based on these same codes.

## Visual Studio Code

This portion of the module was a bit confusing for me and took me a while to understand. Some of the links on the module are broken as well. It was helpful to alternate back and forth to the assignment on Canvas and the module. Once I had **Visual Studio** set up I enjoyed working from this platform. It felt more simplistic than using this [GitHub](https://github.com) web-based platform.
