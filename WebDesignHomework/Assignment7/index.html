<h1><b>Ideas for My Website:</b></h1>
<h2><b>Crafting Ideas</b></h2>
<p>For this section I'd love to create a resource like the ones I refer to when I am looking for projects for myself or my child.<br>
I think it is important to include <s>photos</s> pictures and a brief description, as well as links referring to the parent website in which it was found. </p>
<ul id="Crafting Ideas">
    <li><b>Links</b> and <b>pictures</b> of different projects</li>
    <li>Items for different <b>seasons</b> and <b>holidays</b></li>
        <ul id="Seasons">
            <li><i><a href="activities.html">Fall</a></i> - Leaves, pumpkins, Halloween</il>
            <li><i>Winter</i> - Snow, Christmas, New Year</li>
            <li><i>Spring</i> - Flowers, Easter, Mother's/Father's Days, lifecycles, trees, animals</li>
            <li><i>Summer</i> - Sun, camping, water, ocean</li></ul></ul>
<h2><b>Preschool Food Ideas</b></h2>
<p>Food recipes are always so much fun to do with a child.
 <br>I would like to include easy-to-make recipes as well as recipes made by parents that are child-friendly (that most children would enjoy).</p>
<ul id="Food Ideas">
    <li><b>Links</b> and <b>pictures</b> of different food items</li>
    <li>Filter by <i>type</i></li>
        <ul id="Types of Food">
            <li>Food to make with children</li>
            <li>Meal type</il>
            <li>Occassion</li>
            <li>Level of difficulty</li></ul></ul>
<h2><b>Coloring Pages</b></h2>
<p>I would like to include some easily accessible, <b>printable</b> pages that are free for families to enjoy</p>
<ul id="Coloring Pages">
    <li>Separate by <i>type</i></li>
        <ul id="Types of Coloring Pages">
            <li>Seasonal (<abbr title="Winter">W</abbr>, <abbr title="Spring">SP</abbr>, <abbr title="Summer">SU</abbr>, <abbr title="Fall">F</abbr>)</il>
            <li>Tracing Pages</li>
            <li>Dot Art</li></ul></ul>
<h2><b>Additional Resources for Parents</b></h2>
<ul id="Parent Resources">
    <li>Links to other crafting blogs. For example I would choose something like <a href="https://www.notimeforflashcards.com/2022/05/preschool-crafts.html">this</a>.</li>
    <li>Links to additional food recipes, such as one like <a href=https://www.yummytoddlerfood.com/>this.</li></ul>
