# How to make an egg and dairy-free birthday cake

## Ingredients needed for the vanilla cake
- 3 1/2 cups cake flour
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups almond milk or other non-dairy milk at room temperature
- 4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 2/3 cup light oil
- 2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar
## Instructions for making the cake
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Spray three 8-inch or four 6-inch pans with non-stick spray, line the bottoms of each pan with parchment rounds, and spray again. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, combine the almond milk, vanilla, oil and vinegar. Set aside.
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or regular bowl if mixing by hand), combine the cake flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Stir to combine.
4. With the mixer on low speed or with a hand mixer, add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Stir just until incorporated. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and mix again on low for another 10 to 20 seconds. 
5. Divide the batter evenly between the pans. Bake for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out with just a few moist crumbs on it. 
6. Let cool 10 minutes in the pans before inverting onto wire racks to cool completely. 
7. If needed, level each cake layer with a cake leveler. To store the cake layers, wrap each cake layer in plastic wrap after it’s completely cooled. The cake layers can be stored in the freezer for up to a week with two layers of plastic wrap. To store longer, wrap the layers in an additional layer of foil and place in a zip-lock bag.

## Ingredients needed for the vanilla frosting
- 1 cup unsalted, softened nondairy butter
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- ½1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2-4 tablespoons nondairy milk
## Instructions for making the frosting
1. In a medium bowl, cream soft nondairy butter with an electric hand mixer until smooth, fluffy and whiter in color – about 30 seconds.
2. Add the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon of nondairy milk.
3. Beat on low speed with an electric hand mixer. This prevents the powdered sugar from bursting out of the bowl. Then, increase speed to medium-high speed moving around the bowl to bring all ingredients together.
4. Beat until a smooth, spreadable frosting forms. Don't overbeat.
5. If frosting becomes too thick, beat in more milk, adding a few drops at a time. If frosting becomes too thin, beat in a small amount of extra powdered sugar.
